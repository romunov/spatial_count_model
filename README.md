Following the examples in Spatial capture-recapture book by Royle et al. ([Spatial capture-recapture](http://www.bookdepository.com/Spatial-Capture-Recapture-Andrew-Royle/9780124059399), 2014) I'm trying to evaluate the value of spatial count model against the capture-mark-recapture model. Former model assumes to use only count data (number of individuals) on "traps" while the latter model uses encounter history for each individual is known per "trap". Package is available as a `zip` file [here](https://sites.google.com/site/spatialcapturerecapture/scrbook-r-package).
